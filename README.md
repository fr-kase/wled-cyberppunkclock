# Welcome to my project Cyberpunk Clock
It's my first project so please be kind :)

# Results
First thing, the final design and functionnalyties : 
- Amazing Led CyberPunk Logo based on the wonderful project WLED (with interface and a lot of things)
- Screen to see time, date and if you have sensor temperature and humidity
- Touch screen to switch off the led

Images & videos: 

# Prerequisite & Materials
Skills : 
- Patience
- A little bit of programming
- Electronic you need to know how to solder
Materials:
- A 3D printer
- Electronic stuff like solder & co
- A TFT ili9341 with touch capacity, I used the fanstatic TFT_eSPI library so a lot of other screens are compatible (check on the project)
- A ESP, at the beginning I used an ESP8266 but due to a lack of memory I switch to a ESP32 with PS Ram, in my case it's a ESP32-S2 mini (but there is a lot of ESP32)
- A led strip compatible with WLED (check the project), in my case I bought a smaller led WS2812B with only 5mm large

# Instruction
CyberPunk Logo
I started with CyberPunk logo, this the link to the STL files and I read how other peoples have done the wiring.
For the 3D print, I used default settings, for the case a classic black PLA and for the top I used a semi transparent PETG (because it was in my stock).
After the soldering of all leds is a big job and a little bit tricky, in my case I have done small part outside of the logo and do the connection when it was easy
I've also tested each time with an default WLED installation on my ESP8266 (it was before my switch to ESP32) if leds are correcly connected.
To resume, it was a little bit boring, but at the end, when you try different effect, you've got a first whaou effect
